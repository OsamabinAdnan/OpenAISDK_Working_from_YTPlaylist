# **Topic: Hosted tools and Agent as a tool**

Data are of three type respect to agents

1) Historical Data
2) Personalize data
3) Real time current data

Tools are of three types
1) Hosted tools ==> already hosted on OpenAI, we can use them using paid plans, we used alternative for it. For computer hosted tools (without OpenAI API key), we are using [Browser Use](https://browser-use.com/), for installation go to [Browser Use Github page](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use)
2) Function calling tools
3) Agent as a tool ==> sub agents as a tool
